# GUI-Based-P2P-Simulation
Peer-to-peer systems can be of a very large scale such as millions of nodes, which typically join and leave continously. These properties are very challenging to deal with. Evaluating a new protocol in a real environment, especially in its early stages of development, is not feasible.


Libraries Used:

---SimPy(For refreshing simulation and updating parameters)

---Pygraphviz(For visualizing peers as nodes)

---matplotlib(For plotting the whole graph)

---networkx(For using the graphviz_layout method for layout)

The Variables and ClassNames are Self-Explainatory.

Peer module to create connections and peer objects.

Peermanager module to manage peers.

Disruptions module to control peer parameters.

Message module to form a basic message object.

Visualize module for handling GUI part of the project.


The above repository contains Simulations with 25,30,40,50,100 peers.
